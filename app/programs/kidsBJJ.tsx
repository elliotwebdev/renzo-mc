                  Our kids program invites students aged 6 to 11 to learn in group lessons. Classes will allow your kids to practice in a safe environment and are focused on self-defense and developing a fundamental skill set.

                  To excel in any endeavor, individuals need to have a strong set of values and a solid character that gives them perseverance to achieve his or her goals. The Renzo Gracie Houston Kids BJJ Program was created to provide children to experience and understand core values like focus, discipline, persistence, cooperation and respect.

                  As a contact sport, Renzo Gracie Houston provides a very challenging yet safe and caring environment for a child to mature towards a real life champion. The outcome of continued childhood practice of RGH BJJ goes far beyond the accomplishments on the mats. The discipline and excellence demanded by our instructors often carries over to the child's behavior at home and at school.
