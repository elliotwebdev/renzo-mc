The members were respectful and overall great to be around; almost felt back at home. Want to thank Professor Mike for staying behind a few minutes to show me a technique I had questions about. The building itself has plenty of mat space, it's very clean, has lockers and showers! Overall, it was a great experience and whenever I come back to town I'll definitely be revisiting again!"

The management team is efficient and attentive, the professors are exceptional in their knowledge and quality of instruction,  the kids coaches are caring and skilled, and the community is truly the best there is. RGH feels like a second home. Highly recommended for all ages."

		text: "A great place to practice your BJJ and grappling game with high ranked and very technical jujitsu practitioner especially on their Sunday's open mat but most importantly is their very humble and friendly staff whom will make you feel you're at the right place to have some solid Bjj rolling, learn from them and make a lot of good friends. Highly commended."

		text: "Professor Brian and the team he has assembled are world-class. Every coach is knowledgeable and warm, but tough. The classes are strenuous without being too much and techniques are taught with clear directions and effective methods. My son has grown leaps and bounds in his confidence and competence since he started training at the academy; I'm sure the lessons and skills he's learning here will serve him well throughout his life. The location is always sparkling clean and is well kept with lots of comfortable places to sit. 5/5 would definitely recommend."

		text: "Professor Brian Marvin and team make this a perfect place for anyone to train Jiu-Jitsu at any level. I've been training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu since the 90's in Brazil and my son started recently here - we both couldn't be happier. This place has made my recent move to Houston much easier. The instructors are excellent, the community atmosphere is welcoming to all and the Jiu-Jitsu learned here is world-class. Too bad there is no six-star option for this review!"

		text: "We started here wanting to try something new, and then we stayed because of the teachers and the friends we have made.  When Covid arrived and decided to stick around, Professor Brian took his classes online.  So throughout the summer of nothing to do, Jiu jitsu was our daily constant.  Professors Brian and Joe (and Coach Mayra) are amazing instructors, and we are grateful for their dedication, patience, and for the encouragement they show to our kids.  Definitely recommend every kid to give Jiu jitsu a try!"

		text: "Amazing Jiu-Jitsu school owned and run by Professor Brian Marvin who does so much for the Houston grappling scene AND for veterans. The mat is one of the best I've ever trained on, and they have two bathrooms! üòÑ That may be a low bar for you but it means a lot for those of us who've been around for a while. Anyway, I can't say enough about the school and Professor Brian. They are truly welcoming and accepting to anyone who walks through their doors."

Great Professor (Brian) who always takes time to coach you, clean & spacious facility, team members who are welcoming and willing to help you grow.  Don't take my word for it... just look at the kids programs, the fact that Brian was open EVERY day during the holidays, or the fact that the coach (and students) also actively compete and be the judge for yourself.  Thank You Renzo Gracie Houston for such a great experience.  If I only lived closer, I would definitely be training here!"

One of the great features his school has is their popular open mat.  Friends and visitors are welcomed here for a good training with people from various schools and teams.  It is truly an open mat - very inclusive.  Each time I'm back in Houston I visit here and always leave happy and a little better at Jiu-Jitsu.  I and the rest of the Jiu-Jitsu community are very thankful for this brother we have in Brian Marvin!  üôèüèæü•ãü•ã"
